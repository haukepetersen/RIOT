 * @defgroup    net_gorm Gorm, the daddy of Bluetooth
 * @ingroup     net
 * @brief       Gorm is a light-weight BLE stack for RIOT
 *
 * @warning THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL
 *
 * # About
 *
 * TODO
 *
 * # General Design
 *
 * # Design Objectives
 * - focused on SoCs with included, memory mapped BLE radio
 * - leight-weight
 * - taking shortcuts from the standard here and there -> skipping HCI
 *
 *
 * # Implementation Status
 *
 * Supported roles (as of now):
 * - broadcaster
 * - peripheral
 *
 *
 *
 * # Todos
 *
 * This is a list of things that need to be done in the future, and serves as a
 * rather loose collection of things that should be part of Gorm. This list is
 * in no means complete, but is also not just a diff between implemented
 * features and the BT standard...
 *
 * ## General
 * @todo        enable SCANNER role
 * @todo        enable CENTRAL (GATT client) role
 * @todo        implement L2CAP reliable channel -> IPSP
 * @todo        implement IPv6 over BLE (IPSP)
 *
 * ## Security Manager
 * @todo        Implement
 *
 * ## Link-layer
 * @todo        support channel selection algorithm #2
 * @todo        support extended packet sized
 *
 * ## Implementation specific
 * @todo        cleanup the (sub-)module structure to allow compiling Gorm for
 *              different roles while keeping code-size down
 *
 * TODO sort/fix...
 * @todo        Unify concept of static vs dynamic configuaration values, e.g.
 *             - advertisement intervals (conn vs nonconn)
 * @todo        Address handling: generation of public addresses etc
 * @todo        Use netdev correctly (do proper switching to thread context)
 * @todo        Implement and use `event_post_first()` and use in link layer for
 *              received packets
 * @todo        check for consistent naming of static functions (_x vs x)
